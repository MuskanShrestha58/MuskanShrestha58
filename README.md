### Hi there, I'm Muskan Shrestha! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Django Rest Framework, and AI.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django Rest Framework to enhance my skills and build amazing projects.

ğŸ’¡ I love learning and exploring new concepts, ideas, and intricacies in the world of technology.

ğŸ’» Be sure to check out my repositories for practice code, mini projects, and more!

ğŸš€ Additionally, I'm currently working on a project called "Procrastination Buster," a website focused on self-growth. I plan to create an API for it after acquiring the necessary skills.

Let's connect and learn together! ğŸš€
